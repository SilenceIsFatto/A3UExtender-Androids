> Androids are designed with one simple function: Serve the Higher Society. 

> They do the jobs that are too dangerous for the Higher Society.

> The Vanguard is a unique faction, accepting any androids into their ranks. 

> They are an industrial empire, with a mercenary division to compliment their mining/industrial division. 

> The mercenaries were introduced due to the ongoing pressure from the Android and Replika wars, which were spilling over to the planets that the Vanguard operated on.

> Corrupted are a sub faction of Replikas, they are low level AI within an android shell. 

> They can be deadly in numbers, but by themselves aren't a big threat. Their face plates bear the wounds of timeless battles. Rumours are that you can still hear a faint yet distorted distress signal...
